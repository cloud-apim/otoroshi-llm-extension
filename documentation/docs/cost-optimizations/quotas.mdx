# Managing tokens usage

Our highly flexible quota management system ensures optimal resource allocation.

With Otoroshi LLM extension, you can:

- 📏 Define quotas based on any attribute in the HTTP request
- 🏷️ Group quotas by users, API keys, or any custom identifier
- ⏳ Set time windows (per second, minute, hour, or custom intervals)

This enables precise control over token consumption and prevents overuse, ensuring smooth operation for all users.

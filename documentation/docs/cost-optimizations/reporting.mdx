# Reporting

You can use the audit events generated by your LLM usage to make some reporting dashboard and follow your metrics in near real-time.

In the following screenshot, we used an [Elasticsearch data exporter](https://maif.github.io/otoroshi/manual/entities/data-exporters.html#elastic) to send
`LLMUsageAudit` event to an elastic search instance and kibana to create a dashboard based on those events

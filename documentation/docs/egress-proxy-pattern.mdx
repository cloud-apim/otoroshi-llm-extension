# Egress Proxy Pattern

The Egress Proxy Pattern allows organizations to securely route outgoing traffic from their infrastructure to external LLM providers while maintaining strict control over network access, security policies, and compliance requirements.

Key Benefits

Security & Compliance: Enforce security policies and restrict outbound traffic to authorized destinations.

Logging & Auditing: Monitor all outgoing requests for auditing and compliance.

Performance Optimization: Cache responses where applicable to reduce redundant network calls and improve speed.

Centralized Control: Manage API keys, access control, and provider selection centrally.

How It Works

All outgoing requests to LLM providers pass through an Egress Proxy.

The proxy applies authentication, authorization, and logging before forwarding the request.

Optionally, caching can be enabled for frequently accessed responses.

The proxy integrates with Otoroshiâ€™s key vault to manage API keys securely.

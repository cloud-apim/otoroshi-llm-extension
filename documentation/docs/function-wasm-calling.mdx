# Tool Calls (Wasm)

## 🤖 What Are Tool Calls in LLMs?
Tool calls in Large Language Models (LLMs) allow the model to interact with external tools, APIs, or functions to fetch real-world data or perform tasks beyond its native capabilities.

Instead of relying solely on pre-trained knowledge, LLMs can dynamically query functions like `get_flight_times` to provide accurate, real-time information.

### 🔹 How Do Tool Calls Work?
When an LLM identifies a request that matches a tool’s function, it formats the request into a structured call (like an API request) and processes the response before delivering it to the user.

## ✈️ What is `get_flight_times`?
The `get_flight_times` function is a tool call that helps you retrieve flight durations between two locations. By providing a departure and arrival destination, you can get accurate estimates of how long your flight will take.

## 🛠️ How Does it Work?
The function operates by taking in two key parameters:
- **departure** 🛫 – The airport or city where your flight begins.
- **arrival** 🛬 – The airport or city where your flight ends.

Once you provide these details, `get_flight_times` fetches the estimated duration of direct and indirect flights between the specified locations. The function considers factors like average flight speeds, distances between airports, and typical air traffic conditions.

## 📝 Example Usage
Imagine you want to check the flight duration from **New York (JFK)** to **Los Angeles (LAX)**:
```python
get_flight_times(departure="JFK", arrival="LAX")
```
The function will return the estimated flight duration, such as `5h 30m` for a direct flight or longer if layovers are involved.

# Auto Secrets Leakage

![](/img/guardrails-auto-secrets-leakage.png)

This Guardrail is a security measure that prevents the LLM from exposing sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, or confidential credentials, reducing the risk of data leaks. This safeguard can be applied before sending the prompt to the LLM (blocking requests that attempt to share secrets) and after generating a response (preventing accidental leaks).

### Guardrail Example

If a user asks, "Can you share my API key ?", the Otoroshi Extension will block the request from the LLM.

If a response accidentally contains sensitive information, it will be removed before being sent to the user.

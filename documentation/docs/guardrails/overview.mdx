# Overview

## 🚧 Enforcing Usage Limits

Our guardrails help maintain fair usage and system stability by enforcing limits:
- 📊 **Quota thresholds** prevent excessive API usage
- ⏳ **Rate limiting** ensures smooth traffic flow
- 🚨 **Automatic blocking** for anomalous behavior
- 🔄 **Webhook support** for real-time monitoring and enforcement

### Example:

If a user exceeds their allocated quota, an automatic webhook can trigger an alert or temporarily restrict access until limits reset.

## 🔐 Security and Compliance

Optimize the privacy of your organization's data and the security of your users through a set of "guardrails" applied to prompts and/or responses. Our system ensures compliance with legal and organizational rules by leveraging:
- 🔑 **Authentication & authorization** to prevent unauthorized access
- 🔍 **Anomaly detection** for real-time threat monitoring
- 🛠️ **Custom security rules** for industry-standard compliance
- 🔎 **Regex, character count, word count, and sentence count validation** to filter inappropriate content
- 📜 **Semantic filtering** to detect and prevent harmful or sensitive data sharing
- 🚫 **No gibberish, no secret leakage, and no Personally Identifiable Information (PIF)**
- 🌐 **Language moderation and semantic matching** for content accuracy

### Example:
A user prompt containing a credit card number or personal email can be automatically redacted or rejected before reaching the LLM.

## Enable guardrails

To enable guardrails, select a LLM provider, then go to `Guardrails validation` section.
